Scheduled system: Implemented and simulated the round robin, FIFO, SJF, uni-programming scheduling algorithms using Java. Implemented priority queues for SJF and round quantum counters while kept track of fair resource allocation. Spec: Documented project specs, created test cases and verified algorithm efficiency.

Implemented Round Robin, FIFO, SJF and uni-programming scheduling algorithms using Java
<br>
Implemented a priority queue for SJF to improve scheduling efficiency by giving higher preference to processes with lower burst times.
<br>
Used quantum counters in round-robin scheduling to avoid process starvation and proper CPU time allocation.
